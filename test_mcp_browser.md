# MCP Server Browser Test Instructions

## Summary of Changes

I've implemented a proper MCP server browser that fetches real servers from the Smithery registry instead of using mock data. Here's what was changed:

### 1. Created New Components:
- **`/frontend/src/components/agents/mcp/mcp-server-browser.tsx`** - A new component that displays MCP servers from Smithery
- **`/frontend/src/hooks/use-debounce.ts`** - A debounce hook for search functionality

### 2. Updated Existing Components:
- **`/frontend/src/components/agents/mcp/mcp-configuration-new.tsx`** - Added "Browse MCPs" button that opens the server browser
- **`/frontend/src/components/workflows/MCPConfigurationDialog.tsx`** - Updated imports (prepared for future updates)

### 3. Key Features:
- Fetches real MCP servers from Smithery API using existing hooks
- Shows popular servers by default
- Allows searching all servers
- Displays server metadata (users, creation date, homepage)
- Clean UI with loading states and error handling

## How to Test:

1. **Navigate to an Agent Configuration**:
   - Go to the Agents page
   - Create a new agent or edit an existing one
   - Go to the "MCP Servers" or "Integrations" tab

2. **Look for the New Button**:
   - You should now see a "Browse MCPs" button with a globe icon
   - This replaces or appears alongside the "Browse Apps" button

3. **Click "Browse MCPs"**:
   - A dialog should open showing real MCP servers from Smithery
   - You should see servers like:
     - Excel MCP Server
     - Perplexity Search
     - YouTube Toolbox
     - Gemini Imagen 3.0
     - And many more...

4. **Test Features**:
   - Try searching for servers
   - Switch between "Popular" and "All Servers" tabs
   - Click on a server to select it
   - Check that server metadata (users, dates, homepage links) are displayed

## What Works:
- ✅ Fetching real MCP servers from Smithery API
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Popular/All servers tabs
- ✅ Server selection (basic)
- ✅ Clean UI with loading states

## What Still Needs Work:
- ⚠️ Server configuration after selection (needs proper configuration flow)
- ⚠️ Integration with credential profiles for servers that need API keys
- ⚠️ The workflow MCP dialog still uses some mock data (can be updated similarly)

## API Endpoints Used:
- `/mcp/servers` - Get all MCP servers with search
- `/mcp/popular-servers` - Get popular MCP servers

The backend already has the Smithery API key configured and the endpoints are working properly.
